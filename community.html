 <p>There are many communities you can be part of. Here are some examples of communities I'm part of:
 </p>
 <ul>
    <li>Hack the Hood Community</li>
    <li>My School's community</li>
    <li>The LGBTQ+ community</li>
    <li>The Mexican community</li>
    <li>And many more</li>
<p>I can't list every community I'm a part of but this is just to give an overview of the kinds of communities that people can be part of</p>
